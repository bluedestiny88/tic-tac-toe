#Tic-Tac-Toe

###Summary
The game will utilize the console to display a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Each square would be tied with a
integer between 1–9. One and two players would be supported. For the single player mode, the player 
has the option to choose either to go first or second, or to choose at random who goes first, just 
as it would be for two players. If the player plays against the CPU, there would be an option to 
play on easy or medium (optimal) difficulty. The easy difficulty would be considered “random” 
while the medium would attempt to play more competitively.

###User interaction mode
This would be console or GUI mode supported, as per decision by the developer(s).
I have had prior experience with Java Swing, but I did not get enough practice with it to make it 
viable to work with yet.
